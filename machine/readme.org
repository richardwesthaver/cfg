#+TITLE: machines
This section isn't for generic configurable machine images. These are
primarily for daily drivers, or machines I use with a regular enough
frequency to warrant some creature comforts. They're inherently
opinionated.

Where possible, we run Arch Linux on all devices. This is not always
possible, but typically those instances will receive more attention.
