Unix system user configuration. Similar in spirit to =etc/skel=. This
doesn't do much right now, but will serve as a template for
bootstrapping new users with sensible defaults.

The files in this project can be used to bootstrap a Mercurial public
server configuration. The theme is a bit messy and will be remedied
some time in the future, likely following styles similiar to [[https://hg.rwest.io/rwest_io][rwest_io]]
(currently BulmaCSS-based).

I've been using Emacs since 2016 as my primary editor. I started with
Spacemacs, used Doom for a while, then started rolling my own
configurations. Configuring the Emacs editor requires learning the
Emacs language - emacs-lisp. It is a dialect of Common Lisp which can
be a bit tricky to adapt to for non-Lisp programmers, but it is built
specifically for Emacs.

This meta covers my Emacs modules, configurations, scripts, and other
code written in emacs-lisp. I have a main configuration which is
thousands of lines, but lately I've been experimenting with running
multiple smaller isolated emacs servers, with their own unique
configs.

The (old) main configuration file. A lot of this is getting moved to
our =notes=. The resulting files will be refactored. Despite being
messy, it's still very effective (see [[id:005d2a6e-d34f-45ee-a169-f26fc264c916][Screenshots]]).

Poorman's distributed =nix= config has fallen into disrepair, but I
keep it around for old-time's sake. It might come in handy in the
future, depending on how the Nix ecosystem progresses.
