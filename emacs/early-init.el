;; Commentary:
;; 
;; A few snippets are added here that need to be loaded ASAP on
;; startup, such as UI elements that would otherwise be loaded for a
;; second and then disappear when the `init.el` file is loaded.
;;
;; If any of the below settings are in your `init.el`, I suggest
;; migrating them to `early-init.el`.
