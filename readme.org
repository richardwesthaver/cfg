* Overview
My System Configuration. Built on [[https://lab.rwest.io/ellis/cfg][lab.rwest.io/ellis/cfg]] and mirrored
on [[https://github.com/richardwesthaver/cfg][github]].
- VERSION :: 0.3.1

** Introduction 
As is customary, you should feel free to steal anything you find
useful in this repo, but the really useful things are often refactored
into libraries or programs.

If my memory serves me right, an earlier iteration of this project was
a single org file consisting of a Doom Emacs configuration. Then I
added non-Emacs configs like bash,ssh,gpg and started using Nix for
all my configuration. Eventually I abandoned Nix and resorted back to
the 'standard' melting-pot system configuration methodology.

* Log
** [2023-08-02 Wed] v0.4.0
- not using the PPP much, will come back to it in the coming months
- added a version. current version is 0.3.0, following the legacy of
  Org->Nix->*melting-pot. We're working towards 0.4.0.
- started a lisp system - will be used for configuration management,
  deployment, and editing. See [[file:cfg.asd][cfg.asd]].
- sbcl is a development dependency, shouldn't be necessary for
  deployment (ship binaries and bundles)
  - required cl libs: [[https://lab.rwest.io/ellis/macs][macs]],[[https://lab.rwest.io/ellis/sxp][sxp]]
** [2023-07-14 Fri]
- unlikely to use nushell as login shell
- considering best way to build/test/deploy all these configs
  - will likely leverage sxp and obj libraries
- adding more subrepos.. many arch scripts.. eventually will not need
  most of them
- may not need private subrepo if we finish krypt cli..
** [2023-06-13 Tue 22:45]
Right now, my focus is on portable, deployable, system distributions
of the Linux variety. The goal is to build custom Arch Linux images
and all the machinery involved to deploy images to the following
machines:
- PinePhone Pro (arm)
- Desktops/Laptops (on-site deploy, x86)
- Podman container
- QEMU (arm/x86 VM)
- AWS EC2
