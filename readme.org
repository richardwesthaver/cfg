The top-level makefile can be used for basic local bootstrap but these
files are generally intended to be loaded into a user environment via
the =shed= development tool. I work out of a Linux box 99% of the
time, but most programs are cross-platform. I don't bother with
Windows machines, but there is a =powershell= configuration that
provides some amenities when I need to use one. My default =emacs=
config also works on Windows but YMMV.

The sections below cover configuration of a certain category or
individual application such as =shell= or =emacs= respectively.

* emacs
- what -- Configuration for the superior editor.
- version -- 2.1

I've been using Emacs since 2016 as my primary editor. I started with
[[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]], used [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]] for a while, then started rolling my own
configurations. Configuring the Emacs editor requires learning the
Emacs language - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Emacs Lisp]] or =elisp=. It is a dialect of Common Lisp
which can be a bit tricky to adapt to for non-Lisp programmers (such
as myself), but it is built specifically for Emacs and quite powerful.

This section covers my Emacs packages, configurations, and other code
written in =elisp=.
** default.el
=default.el= provides a package called =default= which is always the
first package loaded in my init file. Why? because it doesn't require
/any/ external packages - only packages included with the vanilla GNU
Emacs distribution. This removes the need to bootstrap a package
manager, download remote packages, and do other things that can impact
startup time. It also guarantees my defaults will work on any platform
that supports vanilla Emacs.

** hyde.el
** config.org
