I have a relatively small set of config files, but they get a lot
done. The sections below cover configuration of a certain category or
individual application such as =shell= or =emacs= respectively.

The top-level makefile is used for basic deployment and publishing,
but these files are generally intended to be loaded into a user
environment via the =shed= development tool.
* emacs
- what -- Configuration for the superior editor.
- version -- 2.1
** Abstract
I've been using Emacs since 2016 as my primary editor. I started with
Spacemacs, used Doom for a while, then started rolling my own
configurations. Configuring the Emacs editor requires learning the
Emacs language - emacs-lisp. It is a dialect of Common Lisp which can
be a bit tricky to adapt to for non-Lisp programmers, but it is built
specifically for Emacs.

This meta covers my Emacs modules, configurations, scripts, and other
code written in emacs-lisp. I have a main configuration which is
thousands of lines, but lately I've been experimenting with running
multiple smaller isolated emacs servers, with their own unique
configs.
** config.org
The (old) main configuration file. A lot of this is getting moved to
our =notes=. The resulting files will be refactored. Despite being
messy, it's still very effective (see [[id:005d2a6e-d34f-45ee-a169-f26fc264c916][Screenshots]]).
